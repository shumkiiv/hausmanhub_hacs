# HASC AI Context

Last updated: 2026-07-14.

## Project state

- Repository: `shumkiiv/hausmanhub_hasc` (public, MIT, `main`).
- Local checkout: `/home/ivsh/projects/hausmanhub_hasc`.
- Home Assistant baseline: Core 2026.6.4 or newer.
- A public `custom_components/hausman_hub/` read-only skeleton is approved
  and present. It may be added manually as an HACS custom repository; it is
  not in the public HACS catalog.
- The skeleton contains a local square `brand/icon.png`, so Home Assistant can
  show its original icon without relying on an external brand asset.
- A Russian safe-check guide is available at
  `docs/home-assistant-safe-check.md`. It guides only HACS refresh,
  installation, and visual confirmation; it explicitly excludes diagnostics
  archives, configuration files, home addresses, credentials, and device data.
- The Home Assistant setup screen uses plain labels: `Только чтение` and
  `Проверка без изменений` in Russian, with matching English labels. Its text
  no longer describes this public repository as private, and a local test
  guards all setup, options, error, and selector text.
- The skeleton passed isolated runtime smoke checks in Home Assistant Core
  2026.6.4 and 2026.7.0 on Python 3.14.3. They used disposable empty
  configurations only; no device, Node-RED, Home Assistant service, or live
  API work was performed. The smoke check also loads the installed diagnostics
  adapter and verifies its fixed redacted report after each approved mode
  change.
- Synthetic Common-contract fixtures, static validators, synthetic shadow
  evidence, and redacted diagnostics/repairs fixtures are present. They use
  Python's standard library and local JSON only.

## Durable decisions

- HASC is a separate repository and has no authority over the existing
  HausMan Hub runtime.
- Initial modes are read-only and shadow only.
- Proxy requires separate owner approval and rollback notes.
- Direct execution remains blocked pending proven shadow parity, a separate
  canary/rollback/authority decision, and owner signoff.
- Do not commit secrets, live identifiers, flow snapshots, service paths,
  command payloads, or deployment scripts.
- Every future code change follows Clean Code and Clean Architecture and must
  receive Kimi review before it is considered complete or pushed.
- The owner approved a public GitHub repository on 2026-07-14 because HACS
  cannot use a private GitHub repository. This permits only the minimal root
  `hacs.json` and manual HACS custom-repository installation. It does not
  approve inclusion in the public HACS catalog, live testing, proxy, or direct
  execution.
- The supported baseline was lowered to Core 2026.6.4 after the isolated
  lifecycle check passed on that exact version. See the [2026.6.4 compatibility
  note](LLM_WIKI/Manual/2026-07-14-core-2026-6-4-compatibility.md).
- Kimi reviewed the 2026.6.4 baseline change. Its only non-blocking note was
  a prompt wording mismatch about a test rename; the final code has no related
  defect. See the [2026.6.4 baseline review
  note](LLM_WIKI/Manual/2026-07-14-kimi-core-2026-6-baseline-review.md).
- Kimi reviewed the local brand icon change with no findings. See the [brand
  icon review note](LLM_WIKI/Manual/2026-07-14-kimi-local-brand-icon-review.md).
- Kimi reviewed the isolated diagnostics smoke-check extension and the manual
  safe-check guide with no findings. See the [safe Home Assistant check review
  note](LLM_WIKI/Manual/2026-07-14-kimi-safe-home-assistant-check-review.md).
- Kimi reviewed the safe-mode language change after one review-fix pass and
  found no final issues. See the [safe-mode language review
  note](LLM_WIKI/Manual/2026-07-14-kimi-safe-mode-language-review.md).
- Kimi reviewed the initial HACS metadata change with no findings before the
  private-HACS limitation was discovered. Its historical review note is
  [here](LLM_WIKI/Manual/2026-07-14-kimi-private-hacs-metadata-review.md).
- Kimi reviewed the correction for the public HACS custom-repository path. It
  found three outdated phrases, which were corrected; the final review had no
  findings. See the [public HACS correction review
  note](LLM_WIKI/Manual/2026-07-14-kimi-public-hacs-correction-review.md).
- Kimi baseline/review-fix pass found no blocking safety or correctness issue
  in the static harness. The follow-up tightened mismatch validation, made
  negative tests assert their intended reason, and covered the CLI failure path.
- Kimi reviewed the approved read-only skeleton. It identified no blocking
  safety issue; a type-hint compatibility question was checked against the
  official Home Assistant 2026.7.0 source and is compatible. See the detailed
  [skeleton review note](LLM_WIKI/Manual/2026-07-13-kimi-read-only-skeleton-review.md).
- Kimi reviewed the isolated config/options-flow adapter test twice: first it
  identified two test-isolation gaps, then confirmed the corrections with no
  remaining findings. See the [adapter review note](LLM_WIKI/Manual/2026-07-13-kimi-config-flow-adapter-review.md).
- Kimi reviewed the isolated real-Core smoke check, then confirmed its
  remediations with no remaining findings. See the [Core smoke-check review
  note](LLM_WIKI/Manual/2026-07-13-kimi-home-assistant-core-smoke-check-review.md).
- Kimi reviewed the expanded real-Core lifecycle check, including both safe
  modes, rejected unsafe options, reload, and removal, with no remaining
  findings. See the [expanded Core lifecycle review
  note](LLM_WIKI/Manual/2026-07-13-kimi-expanded-core-lifecycle-review.md).
- Kimi reviewed the persisted-config exact-key boundary tests and confirmed the
  final version with no remaining findings. See the [persisted-config review
  note](LLM_WIKI/Manual/2026-07-13-kimi-persisted-config-boundary-review.md).
- Kimi reviewed the diagnostics allow-list structure test with no findings. See
  the [diagnostics review note](LLM_WIKI/Manual/2026-07-13-kimi-diagnostics-allow-list-review.md).
- Kimi reviewed the fixed manual-repair category contract with no findings. See
  the [repairs review note](LLM_WIKI/Manual/2026-07-13-kimi-manual-repairs-contract-review.md).

## Verification

Run `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`. This validates only synthetic
schema data and the in-memory config/options adapter boundary; it does not
prove shadow parity, grant any authority, or load Home Assistant. Core 2026.6.4
requires Python 3.14.2 or newer. The isolated Core lifecycle check is
documented in `docs/read-only-skeleton.md`; it proves only that both safe
modes can load, reload, and unload in an empty local Core without service or
entity surfaces. It never proves shadow parity or grants authority.

## Next decision gate

The read-only skeleton is limited to the two approved modes and local,
synthetic verification. Public HACS distribution, proxy, and direct execution
remain out of scope.

The public custom-HACS decision and its narrow implementation boundary are
recorded in the [HACS packaging decision record](docs/hacs-packaging-decision.md).

The required explicit choice is documented in
[the read-only skeleton decision record](docs/read-only-skeleton-decision.md).
Its implementation boundary is documented in
[the read-only skeleton guide](docs/read-only-skeleton.md).
